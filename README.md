# School in the Crowd API

**This api is made to work with the project named above built by a team consisting of UI/UX Web, React FrontEnd, and Backend developers**

<br >

## Introduction
<br>

This api will provide the resources necessary for a React App to log in, out, and display data for users to use. The complete project is built
in a two week period where the team collaborates to get all essential items connected to each other to make one app for the user.

**Make sure to add a .env file with at least the following:**
```
    PORT=5000
    NODE_ENV=development
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:<postgres_password>@localhost:5432/<database_name_in_postgres>

    JWT_SECRET=your secret here... you can convert it to any type of hash online if you like
```

Convert Secret or anything to hash -> [Click Here!](https://www.md5hashgenerator.com/)
- This will convert the secret to an MD5 Hash string
- You can use any hash generator online, just Google **Hash Generator**
